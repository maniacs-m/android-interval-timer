# Interval Timer

A simple interval timer application for Android.

I figured I needed something of this sort to help me with my exercises. I kept looking at the time to see if I had to stop or switch to a different move. Instead of downloading one of the existing interval timer applications in Google Play I made my own.

## Features

* Creating, saving and loading lists
* Intervals can contain descriptions
* Countdown can be stopped and resumed
* Next and previous buttons to move between intervals
